Quantum teleportation is a protocol that transfers an unknown quantum state from one 
location to another using shared entanglement and a classical communication channel, 
without moving the physical particle itself. In this process, a sender (Alice) and a receiver 
(Bob) first share an entangled pair of qubits. Alice then performs a joint Bell-state measurement 
on the qubit she wants to teleport and her half of the entangled pair, which destroys the original
state but instantaneously projects Bob’s distant qubit into a related state. Alice sends the result
of her measurement to Bob using two classical bits, and based on this information Bob applies a
corresponding quantum operation to his qubit. After this correction, Bob’s qubit becomes an exact 
replica of the original quantum state Alice had. Quantum teleportation does not transmit matter 
or energy and never violates the speed of light, but it is a crucial building block for quantum 
networks, quantum repeaters, and long-distance entanglement-based QKD, enabling secure and scalable 
quantum communication.
