Quantum repeaters enable long-distance quantum communication by overcoming photon loss and decoherence 
in optical fibers, using entanglement swapping and quantum memories to extend entanglement across multiple 
shorter segments. They divide a long link into repeater nodes that purify and swap entanglement without measuring 
the quantum information, preserving security for protocols like QKD.

​
Definition

Quantum repeaters are network nodes that relay quantum states via entanglement generation over elementary links, 
followed by purification to improve fidelity and swapping to connect distant pairs. Unlike classical repeaters, 
they avoid no-cloning by never amplifying signals directly.

​
Purpose

Repeaters make practical quantum networks over continental or global scales viable, supporting secure QKD, teleportation, 
and distributed quantum computing beyond the ~100-500 km repeaterless limit. They eliminate trusted nodes in current long-haul systems.

​
Benefits for Long-Distance Links

Quantum repeaters achieve polynomial scaling of key rates with distance, versus exponential decay without them, enabling kHz-rate 
QKD over 10^4 km even with 10^{-3} error rates. They provide end-to-end security without intermediate data exposure.

​
Example Architecture

In a first-generation repeater chain, Alice and Bob connect via node R: generate entanglement Alice-R and R-Bob, purify noisy 
pairs at R, then perform Bell-state measurement at R to swap, yielding Alice-Bob entanglement. Repeat across multiple nodes for longer reach.

​
How It Works

Elementary entanglement: Create Bell pairs over short links (~50-100 km) using photon sources and memories.​

Purification: Locally distill higher-fidelity pairs from multiple noisy ones via interference and detection.​

Swapping: At each repeater, joint measurement (e.g., Bell projection) on two qubits links adjacent segments, teleporting entanglement forward.

End protocol: Final pair enables QKD or teleportation; classical signaling coordinates without revealing data. Advanced generations add error correction for fault tolerance.
