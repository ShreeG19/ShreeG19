MDI-QKD stands for Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution, 
a quantum cryptography protocol that enables secure key sharing between parties 
without trusting the measurement devices. It addresses vulnerabilities in standard 
QKD by having two users send quantum states to a central untrusted node for interference 
and measurement, ensuring security even if detectors are compromised.

​
Invention Purpose

Traditional QKD protocols like BB84 are susceptible to side-channel attacks on 
imperfect detectors, which could leak information to eavesdroppers. Invented around 
2012 (with experimental demos shortly after), MDI-QKD eliminates these "detector 
loopholes" by design, making it ideal for practical, real-world networks where 
third-party hardware can't be fully trusted.

​
Usefulness and Advantages

MDI-QKD offers information-theoretic security, scalable networking via 
central hubs, and resilience to sophisticated attacks, supporting secure 
communications over fiber optics up to hundreds of km. It's highly useful 
for banking, government, and future quantum internet infrastructure, with 
gigahertz implementations achieving key rates up to kbps over 30-50 dB loss.

​
Latest Developments

As of 2025, advancements include integration into hybrid networks, asymmetric variants 
for uneven channel losses, and high-rate systems (e.g., GHz-clocked demos). Recent 2025 
research focuses on practical deployments and combining with post-quantum crypto for quantum-safe networks.
