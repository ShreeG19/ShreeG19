Exploring the landscape of Quantum Communication

Types of quantum communication that exist today:

• Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) – BB84, E91, MDI-QKD
• Entanglement-based communication
• Quantum Teleportation
• Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC)
• Quantum Secret Sharing (QSS)
• Quantum Dense Coding
• Quantum Repeaters (long-distance quantum links)
• Satellite-based quantum communication
• Quantum Networks / Quantum Internet
• Hybrid models with Post-Quantum Cryptography

My interest is in how these technologies shape future cybersecurity and secure communication.
