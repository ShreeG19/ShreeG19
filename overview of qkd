Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a secure way of sharing encryption keys using the principles 
of quantum mechanics. Because quantum states change when observed, any eavesdropping attempt 
is immediately detectable, making the communication fundamentally secure.

BB84, the first QKD protocol, uses polarized photons and random measurement bases to create secure keys and remains the backbone of many real-world QKD systems. 
E91 improves security by using quantum entanglement and Bell inequality tests to verify genuine quantum correlations. 
MDI-QKD further strengthens QKD by removing trust in detectors, protecting against side-channel attacks and enabling scalable, long-distance quantum networks.

Overall, QKD offers information-theoretic security that is resistant to quantum computer attacks. 
While challenges like distance and cost exist, modern protocols such as MDI-QKD are making QKD 
increasingly practical for applications in telecom, banking, defense, and future quantum internet infrastructure.
