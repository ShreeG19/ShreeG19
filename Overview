What is E91 Entanglement-Based QKD?
E91 is a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol proposed by Artur Ekert (1991).
It uses quantum entanglement to allow two parties (Alice and Bob) to generate a shared secret key in a provably secure way.
In an E91 Qiskit demo, this protocol is simulated using Qiskit to show how entangled qubits can be used to create secure keys and detect eavesdropping.

Why is E91 used?
    🔐 1. Unconditional Security
    
            Security comes from laws of quantum physics, not math problems.
            
            Any eavesdropping disturbs entanglement
            
            Disturbance is detectable
    
    🔗 2. Uses Quantum Entanglement
            
            Alice and Bob share entangled qubit pairs
            
            Measurements are strongly correlated
            
            These correlations cannot be faked classically
    
    🚨 3. Eavesdropper Detection (Bell Test)
    
            Uses Bell inequality (CHSH) violation
            
            If Eve tries to intercept → Bell violation decreases
            
            This instantly signals an attack
    
    🧠 4. Device-Independent Security (Conceptually)
    
            Security does not rely on trusting devices
            
            Only on observed quantum correlations
            
            This makes E91 very powerful in theory
    
    🧪 5. Why Qiskit Demo?
    
            The Qiskit demo is used to:
            
            Simulate entangled states
            
            Show measurement outcomes
            
            Demonstrate key generation
            
            Understand attack detection
            
            Learn quantum cryptography without real hardware
