BB84 is a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol that enables two parties to securely share encryption keys over an insecure 
channel using quantum principles. Developed in 1984 by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard, it leverages the no-cloning theorem 
and quantum measurement disturbance to detect eavesdroppers.

​
Core Purpose

BB84 generates secret keys for symmetric encryption, ensuring information-theoretic security independent of 
computational assumptions. It addresses vulnerabilities in classical key exchange methods, like those susceptible 
to future quantum computers breaking RSA. Parties use it whenever secure communication is needed over untrusted 
links, such as in finance, government, or military applications.

​
How It Works

Alice sends photons polarized in one of four states (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°) randomly chosen from two bases 
(+ or ×). Bob measures each photon in a randomly selected basis, then they publicly compare bases—discarding 
mismatches—and check error rates to detect interception. Surviving bits form the raw key, refined via error 
correction and privacy amplification.

​
Key Benefits

Any eavesdropping (e.g., by Eve) disturbs quantum states, introducing detectable errors above 11% quantum 
bit error rate (QBER), aborting the key if tampered. It provides provable security against all attacks, 
including those exploiting device imperfections when enhanced. Unlike classical methods, security holds 
even against unlimited computing power.

Latest Developments

In 2025, efficient-BB84 with optical switches enabled scalable 4-node QKD networks in production 
environments, supporting metropolitan-scale secure services and minute-scale rekeying over 100 Gbps 
backbones. Enhancements like decoy states, MDI-QKD, and zero-knowledge proofs bolster it against 
photon-number-splitting and side-channel attacks. Implementations on platforms like Amazon Braket 
demonstrate practical quantum simulations.
