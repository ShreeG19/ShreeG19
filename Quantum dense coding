Quantum dense coding, also known as superdense coding, is a quantum communication protocol 
that allows sending two classical bits of information by transmitting just one qubit, provided 
the sender and receiver share prior entanglement. It doubles the classical communication capacity 
over a quantum channel using shared quantum resources.

​

Definition :

Quantum dense coding encodes two classical bits (00, 01, 10, or 11) onto one qubit 
from a pre-shared entangled pair through single-qubit unitary operations. The receiver 
decodes both bits by jointly measuring the qubit against their half of the entanglement, 
exploiting quantum correlations.

​

Purpose :

It efficiently boosts data rates in quantum networks where entanglement is available, 
serving as a primitive for quantum communication protocols and enhancing channel utilization 
beyond classical limits. Dense coding complements teleportation, forming the basis for scalable 
quantum repeaters and distributed quantum computing.

​

Benefits in QKD Context :

Dense coding improves entanglement-based QKD by allowing efficient classical message transmission 
over the quantum channel after key sifting, reducing overhead in hybrid systems. It enables 
higher-throughput secure communication when paired with QKD-generated keys, optimizing bandwidth 
in noisy quantum links.

​

Example Scenario :

Alice wants to send "11" to Bob; they share a Bell state 12(∣00⟩+∣11⟩)2

1(∣00⟩+∣11⟩), with Alice holding qubit 0 and Bob qubit 1. ​ Alice applies Z then X 
gates to her qubit (encoding 11), sends it to Bob, who performs CNOT (qubit 0 control), 
Hadamard on qubit 0, and measures both qubits to recover "11". 

​

How It Works : 

Share entanglement: Create and distribute a Bell pair, e.g., apply Hadamard to qubit 0 then CNOT (0→1), yielding 12(∣00⟩+∣11⟩)2

1(∣00⟩+∣11⟩). ​

Encode message: Alice applies gates to her qubit based on bits—no op for 00, X for 01, Z for 10, ZX for 11—modifying the joint state predictably.

Transmit qubit: Alice sends her qubit to Bob via quantum channel.

Decode: Bob applies CNOT (received qubit→his qubit), Hadamard on received qubit, then measures both in computational basis;
outcomes directly give the two bits. Eavesdropping disturbs the state, detectable via error checks
