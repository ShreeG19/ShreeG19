Hybrid models combine quantum cryptography (like QKD for key generation) with post-quantum cryptography 
(PQC, e.g., lattice-based algorithms resistant to quantum attacks) to provide layered security during the 
transition to full quantum-safe systems. They leverage QKD's information-theoretic security with PQC's 
computational hardness, mitigating risks from "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks.

​
Definition

Hybrid schemes integrate quantum methods (QKD, entanglement) for keys with classical/PQC algorithms 
(Kyber/ML-KEM, Dilithium) in protocols like TLS, using dual key exchanges or signatures for defense-in-depth.
Examples include QKD-derived keys encrypting PQC handshakes or parallel classical+PQC encapsulations.

​
Purpose

These models bridge current infrastructure to quantum threats: QKD offers provable security but needs hardware, 
while PQC runs on classical systems but relies on unproven assumptions; hybrids ensure resilience if one fails. 
They enable crypto-agility for standards like NIST's PQC suite.

​
Benefits Over Pure Approaches

Hybrids resist both quantum computers (via PQC/QKD) and classical exploits (via proven classical/PQC combos), 
with minimal performance overhead in protocols like HPKE or MLS. They support seamless migration, e.g., ECDH + Kyber in TLS 1.3.

Examples
     Model Type	            Components	                        Use Case
     QKD + PQC	        QKD keys + Kyber KEM	              Secure data links​
   Classical + PQC	       ECDH + ML-KEM               encapsulation	TLS handshakes​
   Dual Signatures	     ECDSA + Dilithium	              Firmware verification

​
How They Work

Key Exchange: Perform parallel exchanges (e.g., ECDH and Kyber), derive shared secret via KDF from both outputs.​

Signatures: Sign message with classical and PQC schemes; verify both.

QKD Integration: Use QKD for session keys encrypting PQC-wrapped traffic. Deploy in VPNs/TLS with fallback if one fails; ENISA/NIST recommend for transition
