Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC) transmits confidential messages directly over quantum channels 
using quantum states, with security ensured by real-time eavesdropping detection rather than pre-shared keys. 
Unlike QKD, which generates keys for later encryption, QSDC encodes the actual message bits into the quantum carriers themselves.

​
Definition

QSDC protocols send secret data via quantum particles like photons, employing block transmission, 
orthogonal state encoding, and monitoring to detect interference. Any eavesdropping alters measurable 
quantum properties, alerting parties before the message decodes.

​
Purpose

QSDC enables direct, information-theoretically secure message delivery without classical ciphertext or 
long-term key storage, ideal for high-security scenarios like military or financial communications. 
It overcomes QKD limitations by avoiding key management overhead.

​
Benefits in QKD Context

While distinct from QKD, QSDC complements it by providing end-to-end secure data transfer; QKD can 
secure initial checks, but QSDC extends to direct messaging with similar eavesdropper detection via 
quantum bit error rates. It supports multi-user networks and repeaters for longer distances.

​
Example: DL04 Protocol

The Deng-Long (DL04) single-photon protocol splits transmission into blocks: first for security checks 
via random sampling, then message encoding on verified states. Receiver decodes via measurement after 
confirmation, as in fiber experiments achieving high fidelity.

​
How It Works

Security check phase: Sender transmits a block of quantum states (e.g., polarized photons in random bases); receiver measures and announces bases/results publicly for error rate estimation.

Message encoding: On low-error confirmation, sender encodes message bits (e.g., 0 as horizontal polarization, 1 as vertical) into a second block and sends.

Decoding and verification: Receiver measures in announced bases; high correlations confirm no eavesdropping, yielding the direct message without key sifting. Protocols like entanglement-based variants use Bell measurements for added security.
