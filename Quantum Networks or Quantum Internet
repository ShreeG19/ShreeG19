Quantum networks, often termed the quantum internet, interconnect quantum computers, sensors, 
and devices via quantum links to share entanglement and relay quantum information globally. They 
extend QKD and protocols like teleportation beyond point-to-point, enabling distributed quantum computing and sensing.

​
Definition

A quantum internet comprises nodes with quantum processors/memories linked by quantum repeaters and 
channels, distributing entanglement on demand for applications like blind quantum computing. Unlike 
classical internet, it preserves fragile quantum states without measurement until use.

​
Purpose

Quantum networks provide unbreakable security for communication, ultra-precise distributed sensing 
(e.g., gravitational waves), and modular quantum computing across distant hardware. They aim for universal 
entanglement routing, with layers for memory, repeaters, end-end links, and applications.

​
Key Components
Quantum repeaters: Bridge lossy links via purification/swapping.​

Entanglement sources: Generate/distribute Bell pairs.​

Quantum memories: Store qubits for synchronization.​

Switches/routers: Direct entanglement flows.
​

Example: Current Prototypes
Netherlands' Quantum Internet Alliance tests 10+ node metro networks with repeaters;
China's Micius satellites link ground QKD over 7,600 km; U.S. efforts like NIST's aim for city-scale by 2030.

​
How It Works
Link layer: Generate elementary entanglement over short segments.
Network layer: Repeaters purify and swap to create long-distance pairs.
Transport layer: Protocols like DLCZ route and manage sessions.
Application: Use entanglement for QKD, teleportation, or cloud quantum access; classical channels coordinate. Full rollout requires error-corrected links by late 2020s
