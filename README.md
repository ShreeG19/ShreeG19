🚀 Starting a New Project: E91 Entanglement-Based QKD (Qiskit Demo)

I’m beginning work on a small but exciting project:
a proof-of-concept implementation of the E91 entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol using Qiskit.

This project will explore:

🔗 Creatin Bell pairs (entanglement)
🎯 Alice and Bob's measurement bases
📊 Calculating CHSH S-values
🔐 Using quantum correlations to generate secure keys
🧪 Testing how noise affects Bell inequality violation
🛡️ Showing how E91 detects eavesdropping

Right now, the repo is just getting started — I’ll be adding:

 -Code simulations
 -Qiskit circuits
 -Visual diagrams
 -Explanation notes
 -Results and graphs

This project is mainly for learning, experimenting, and sharing how E91 works in a simple, beginner-friendly way.

More updates coming soon! 🚀
