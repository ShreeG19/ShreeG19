🚀 Starting a New Project: E91 Entanglement-Based QKD (Qiskit Demo)

I’m beginning work on a small but exciting project:
a proof-of-concept implementation of the E91 entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol using Qiskit.

This project will explore:

🔗 Creatin Bell pairs (entanglement)
🎯 Alice and Bob's measurement bases
📊 Calculating CHSH S-values
🔐 Using quantum correlations to generate secure keys
🧪 Testing how noise affects Bell inequality violation
🛡️ Showing how E91 detects eavesdropping

Right now, the repo is just getting started — I’ll be adding:

 -Code simulations
 -Qiskit circuits
 -Visual diagrams
 -Explanation notes
 -Results and graphs

This project is mainly for learning, experimenting, and sharing how E91 works in a simple, beginner-friendly way.

More updates coming soon! 🚀


Day 2: Started Qiskit learning
Today I got introduced to Qiskit learning.
I feel this is my first step toward starting my journey in quantum computing.
I’m excited to explore this field further and learn more along the way.

If you have experience in quantum computing, I’d be happy to hear your story—
how you started, what helped you the most, and any advice for beginners.
