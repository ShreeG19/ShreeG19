What is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)?

  In simple terms, QKD is a way to share encryption keys so securely that any spying attempt is immediately noticeable.
  Instead of relying only on math or complex algorithms, QKD uses the laws of quantum physics to protect data.

Why do we need QKD?

    Today’s digital security depends heavily on mathematical problems.
    But with the rise of quantum computers, many current encryption methods may no longer be safe.
    
    QKD solves this by making security physics-based, not assumption-based.

What does QKD actually do?
    QKD doesn’t send messages.
    It securely shares the secret key used to encrypt messages.
    If someone tries to intercept the key:
       Quantum states change
       Errors appear
       The intrusion is detected instantly
       The key is discarded
       No guessing. No silent spying.

How is QKD helpful for digital security?
    Detects eavesdropping in real time
    Protects encryption keys before data is sent
    Resistant to quantum computer attacks
    Adds a strong security layer to existing systems
    QKD works alongside classical encryption, making communication far more secure.

Why QKD matters
    In a world moving toward quantum computing, QKD is a future-ready security solution already being explored for:Financial systems, Government communications, Defense and satellite networks
