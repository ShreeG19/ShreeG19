Quantum Secret Sharing (QSS) extends classical secret sharing into the quantum realm, using entangled states to 
divide a secret among multiple parties so that only authorized subsets can reconstruct it. It leverages quantum 
principles like no-cloning and entanglement detection to ensure security against eavesdroppers or dishonest participants.

​
Definition

QSS splits a classical or quantum secret into quantum shares distributed via entangled particles, such as
GHZ states, where individual shares reveal nothing alone. Only when a threshold number (k out of n participants) 
collaborate does the full secret emerge, with errors signaling tampering.

​
Purpose

QSS enables secure multi-party computation and key distribution, preventing any single party or insufficient group 
from accessing the secret, ideal for distributed quantum networks or joint secure operations. It surpasses
classical schemes by detecting quantum attacks in real-time.

​
Benefits in QKD Context

QSS enhances QKD by allowing multi-user key generation where subsets share partial keys, but full secure 
keys require group cooperation, improving resilience in networks. It supports threshold cryptography, 
reducing single-point failures in entanglement-based QKD extensions.

​
Example: GHZ-Based Protocol

In the original Hillery-Shor-Weng (HSW) scheme, Alice creates a GHZ state 12(∣000⟩+∣111⟩)2
1(∣000⟩+∣111⟩) and sends qubits to Bob and Charlie. ​ They measure randomly in X or Z bases, 
announce bases publicly, and combine matching results; correlations reconstruct Alice's secret bit 50% of the time after verification.

​
How It Works

Share distribution: Dealer generates an entangled state like GHZ and sends one qubit per participant via quantum channel.

Measurement phase: Participants randomly choose bases (e.g., X/Y or Z), measure, and publicly share basis choices but not outcomes.

Reconstruction and check: Authorized group compares a subset of results to verify entanglement (e.g., via error rates); matching bases yield secret shares for full recovery, with privacy amplification if needed. Dishonest parties or Eve disturb correlations, aborting the protocol.
